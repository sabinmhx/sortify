# Sortify: Sorting Visualizer in Java

### This sorting algorithm visualizer project helps to visualize how the sorting algorithms work.

## Description

The Sorting Algorithms Visualizer project is a Java application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive and intuitive interface to observe how different sorting algorithms perform and compare their efficiency. This project serves as an educational tool to help learners understand the inner workings of sorting algorithms and their respective time complexities.

## ðŸ“±Installation

To run the Sorting Algorithms Visualizer project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
   
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sabinmhx/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
    ```
3. Change directory to the project folder:
   
    ```
    cd sorting-algorithms-visualizer
    ```
5. Compile the Java source files:
   
    ```
    javac *.java
    ```

## Usage
4. Once the installation is complete, run the Sorting Algorithms Visualizer application with the following command:
   
    ```
    java SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
    ```

After the application launches, you will be presented with a graphical user interface that allows you to interact with the visualizer.

- Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.
- Set the array size and sorting speed using the provided sliders.
- Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array for sorting.
- Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization of the selected algorithm.
